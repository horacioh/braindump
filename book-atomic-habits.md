## Why

### Why did I read this book?

I wanted to read this book from the many recommendations from people I admire. Also felt like a good way to continue learning about habits after I read the book [The power oh Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X) (which is mentioned in this book).

### Why should you read this book?

If you want to understand why you do what you do and

## Notes

- Changes that seems small today, will compound into remarkable results in the future. With the same habits you get the same results, but with better habits, you can accomplish anything.
- The results you get have little to do with the goals you set, but everything to do with the systems you follow.
- "The porpouse of setting goals is to win the game, the porpouse of building systems is to continue playing the game"
- habits are the atoms of your life, each one of them contributes to the remarkable results you will get in life. They are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1% better everyday, counts for a lot on the long run.
- Habits are a double-edge sword: they can work for you or against you, that's why you need to be careful and understand the details.
- big changes come often after a series of little changes, you need to be patience because they are delayed.
- If you want better results, forget about setting goals, focus on your system. "You do not rise by the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems"
- Changing our habits is challenging got two reasons: We try to change the wrong thing, and we try to change it in the wrong way.
- The best way to create and keep a habit, is to make it part of your identity
- Progress requires un-learning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuosly edit your believes and upgrade and expand your identity.
- Your habits are how you embody your identity. when you write each day, you EMBODY the identity of a writer.
- New identities requires two steps: Decide who you want to be and prove it to yourself with small wins

- The four laws of behaviour change:

  - Make it obvious (Cue)
  - make it attractive (Craving)
  - make it easy (Response)
  - make it sattisfying (Reward)

- ther inversion of those laws helps to break bad habits
  - Make it invisible (Cue)
  - make it un-attractive (Craving)
  - make it difficult (Response)
  - make it un-sattisfying (Reward)

To help you follow these four laws, ask yourself:

- HOW I can make it obvious?
- HOW I can make it attractive?
- HOW I can make it easy?
- HOW I can make it sattisfying?

- The process of behaviour change, starts with awareness. Habits usually are automatic, so the way to start changing them, is to bring them to a more concious space in our brains. Verbalizing them is a good way to do it.
- Avoid mixing context with more than one action: don't work on the couch or kitchen, find a special place to work. Each room/space, one use.
- The way to improve perseverence, willpower and grit, you need to create a more discipline environment.
- Self control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. Find a way to eliminate the cues to your bad habits, to make them invisible.
- Temptation bundleling: pair and action you want to do, with an action you need to do.
- Culture play a big role on your habits. We tend to fit in rather than do the right thing or the best for us. Try to find a group that embodies the culture you want to have.
- Focus on taking action, not being in motion. The amount of time you take on performing a habit, is not as important as how much times you do it. You will gain a new habit easily by repetition, not by perfecting it.
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Remove the friction as much as possible to make good habits easy.

## Summary

## Highlights

- For one year, I consistently wrote _almost_ every week.
- The keyword here is “almost.” According to the Cambridge Dictionary, consistency is “the quality of always behaving or performing in a similar way.”
- The problem with rigid consistency is that it does not reflect the way life works
- Rather than a specific framework, flexible consistency is a mindset.
- offers a set of principles to bounce back and keep on making progress.

### Plan for Disruption

- You can not expect to predict all events, but you can create a contingency plan to make sure they don’t derail your routines over the long term.

### Fail like a Scientist

- Learning is a perpetual experiment. Whenever things don’t go to plan, see it as a personal growth opportunity. Failing like a scientist means overcoming our fixed mindset, and considering every result is a new data point—whether it was the result you wanted or not.

### Schedule over scope

- “Reduce the scope, but stick to the schedule.”
- the problem with the "focus on a specific goal" approach is that we just tend to skip a session if suddenly there doesn’t seem to be enough time
- It’s not always perfect, I did have to skip a couple of editions, and sometimes I wished I had more time. But by planning for disruption, failing like a scientist, and reducing the scope when needed, I manage to stick to an overall schedule.

### Mindful time-blocking

- The crucial part of mindful time-blocking is to be flexible. Blocks can be moved or made shorter. Ideally, try to never delete a block. This only works because you need to be highly selective with time blocks in the first place.
- if something's come up:
  - move the block
  - shorten the block
  - delete the block (should be avoided)

> It’s okay when things don’t work out exactly as we planned. Long-term success is not a result of being perfect all the time, which is impossible. It’s the result of showing up consistently. That’s only possible if we accept the inherent chaos of life.

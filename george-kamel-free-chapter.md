INTRODUCTION
Average Sucks
When the whole world is running toward a cliff, he who is running in the opposite direction appears to have lost his mind. – C. S. LEWIS

     It’s December 15, 2021, and I’m standing in my front yard staring at some dead grass. (Which I often do, as if the longer I stare, the more likely I am to bring it back from the dead.) But something is different about this day. This day, it is my dead grass. I own every blade of it, free and clear, because my wife and I have just paid off our mortgage.

     Whitney and I were thirty-one and thirty-two years old respectively, and I never thought we’d be here. I thought paid-for houses were mythical unicorns reserved for retirees, rich people, and trust fund kids with inheritances. Not for the little guys like me who didn’t learn about money growing up, and made money mistakes with several zeroes on the end.

     In the third grade, Mrs. Plunkett asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up. I, of course, wanted to be an astronaut. I had recently picked up a copy of The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley: The Case of the U.S. Space Camp Mission from the Scholastic Book Fair and was totally sold on the idea of exploring this great frontier. (In hindsight, I think eight-year-old George was just excited about the idea of floating in zero gravity. Still, a noble goal.)

     In the fourth grade, my plans changed dramatically. I got my first electric guitar and decided I was destined to be a rock star. Back in those days, you could supposedly be whatever you wanted to be. As a millennial, I grew up in a generation where everyone was special and we all got a participation trophy (even if our soccer team never won a single game. Season. After. Season).

     I had different goals back then. I had different fears back then. I went through a phase where I was genuinely concerned about the Bermuda Triangle. And quicksand. Both turned out to be much less of a problem than anticipated. Nobody warned me about the real problems, like money problems, that would drag me down (quicksand pun most intended) in adulthood.

The (Not So) Average George
     Like none of you, I grew up as an Arabic Baptist, pop-punk-loving skateboarder in a mostly Irish/Italian Catholic suburb of Boston, Massachusetts. I was fascinated by money at a young age, especially once I figured out how to get some of it. My dad would give me a dollar to go up to random people at church and say something in Arabic. I had no idea what these phrases meant, but they always got a laugh. And the bonus: I was a buck richer every time.

     My dad and mom emigrated from Egypt and Syria (respectively) to the US back in the early 1980s. My brother and I were born stateside, and my parents worked hard to get good jobs and give us a good life. They adapted to American culture very quickly. Including its money culture, where everyone was encouraged to use other people’s money to buy stuff with shiny plastic cards offering virtually unlimited dollars.

     I learned that a high credit score meant you were crushing it with money. I learned that the secret to getting a cool car wasn’t having the cash to pay for it but being able to negotiate the financing to get a good “deal” and manage the monthly payment.

     What did I do with all this learning? I financed my way through college using Sallie Mae’s monopoly money. All I had to do was sign the dotted line and the money was mine.

     I had no idea what the interest was or what the payments would be. I just figured that at the end of the obligatory college-degree rainbow was a pot of gold that included a dream job and a big ol’ salary. And it wasn’t just me thinking that. This treacherous trail of hyped half-truths was sold to my entire generation. And it’s still sold today by college marketers, student loan companies, and well-meaning guidance counselors and parents all over America.

     What I can tell you is: Ignorance was bliss. Until it was broke.

     There I was—a newly minted college grad who was banking on a job that would pay the bills. And that included the impending student loan payments that were about to kick in. Sadly, I didn’t even know how much total debt I had until I experienced identity theft and pulled my credit report. Once I tallied up all my student loans, I discovered my total: 36 grand. (Narrator: “And there was nothing grand about that.”)

     Turns out it was not monopoly money after all. Like the schoolyard bullies of my youth, Sallie Mae shook me down for all I was worth—which wasn’t much, considering I had a negative net worth thanks to, you know, all those loans she lent me.

     I found myself at the crossroads of bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, and flat-broke. To cover the gap between my life and my bills, I turned to my Discover and American Express Delta cards to save the day. But $4,000 in credit card debt later, I had a decision to make. Was I going to pay on my student loans for the next twenty years? Was I going to continue racking up credit card debt while justifying it with 2 percent cash back and freakin’ SkyMiles? Nah, it was time for a change. Getting into debt was remarkably easy, but even as a twenty-three-year-old knucklehead, I knew getting out would be remarkably hard.

     I also knew my debt was holding me back, because it was stealing from the little income I had. I remember depositing that first paycheck from my first job after college and realizing it was barely enough to cover my rent, utilities, and debt payments. That lump-in-the-throat, pit-of-the-stomach feeling was starkly different from the warm fuzzy feeling I was given on the college campus tour. With no breathing room in my money or my life, I was riddled with anxiety and cynical toward adulthood. But I didn’t know how to reverse course and get out of debt. I had fallen for the traps of a screwed-up financial system, and my new reality had left me in a dark place.

     Thankfully, my first salaried job out of college happened to be at a company run by a guy named Dave Ramsey. As part of the onboarding process, I went through a course called Financial Peace University. Once a week for nine weeks straight, I’d meet up with a bunch of strangers at a local church to watch a video lesson about money, followed by some candid group conversation. Although these strangers came from all walks of life, we all had one major thing in common: We wanted to be better with money, and we realized our plan thus far wasn’t cutting it. (The first step is to admit you have a problem, right?)

     Through the videos, I learned about the toxic money culture in America today and how it thrives on keeping people broke. Even more importantly, I discovered the many ways I’d bought in to it and was being affected by it. I began deprogramming all the lies and myths I had come to believe about money for the first few decades of my life.

     By the second week of Financial Peace University, we had a “plastectomy” where we took scissors to our credit cards and physically cut up those bad boys. It was weirdly emotional and even a little frightening. Those cards had been my security blanket and companion into adulthood, much like Woody was to Andy in Toy Story. And just like Woody, there were strings attached. The metal blades slicing through the plastic felt like cutting the strings from a toxic relationship—a one-sided relationship that cost me far more than the 2 percent “effort” it gave in the form of cash back. Feeling a newfound sense of liberation, I created my first budget ever, started tracking my expenses, and set big money goals. For the first time in my life, I felt like I was happening to my money instead of it just happening to me.

     After 18 grueling months of budgeting, living on less than I made, side hustling, Uber-ing, Lyft-ing, selling stuff, and eating “rice and beans” (or in my case, Lean Cuisines), I paid off all $40,000 of my consumer debt! I was debt-free, baby! Less than six months later, I had saved up a fully funded emergency fund. Right after that, I started investing in my work’s 401(k) plan, harnessing the magical power of compound interest.

     That was a long time ago, but I still remember the feeling of living paycheck to paycheck. Every payday felt less like a celebration and more like a quick gasp for air before diving back into a sea of bills and expenses. Turns out, I wasn’t alone. With almost 8 out of 10 American workers (78 percent) living paycheck to paycheck, I was normal. And let me tell you, if broke is normal, then normal sucks!

 

Escaping Average
     A few years into my career at Ramsey Solutions, I met my now-wife, Whitney. She was (and is) way better looking than me, way smarter, and way better at money management. Naturally, I didn’t think I had a shot. But it turns out she’s got a soft spot for pale Middle Eastern guys under 5’ 8”—and she gave me a chance. I turned the wit and charm up to 11 and somehow won her over. We started off our marriage with no consumer debt back in 2018 and decided to do something extra weird: save up a big down payment on a house, and then pay it off as fast as possible. Why?

     Well, we asked ourselves some simple yet revolutionary questions:
     How cool would it be to not have a mortgage payment in our early thirties?
     What kind of freedom could we have?
     What new and incredible options would that open up for us? What kind of life could we live?

     And with that unity and vision, we were off to the races.

     From side hustles to no-spend months to selling anything collecting dust to strangers on Facebook Marketplace, we weren’t fooling around. Twenty-six months later, way ahead of schedule, Whitney and I paid off the dang house!

     To be honest, the payoff itself was hilariously anticlimactic. First off, the mortgage website didn’t have a magic Payoff button with digital confetti. Instead, we had to request a physical payoff statement via snail mail. Ugh. Once we received that, we still couldn’t pay it off online. We had to go to the bank in person to do a final wire transfer. The bank was sad and sterile, much like the DMV, but with less wait time and more lollipops.

     The banker sat us down and began the process of the wire transfer. This was a life-changing moment for me and my wife—but seemingly just another financial transaction for this lady. Here’s how it went down.

     Us (excited): “Hello! We’d like to do a wire transfer!”
     Banker: “Is this for a home closing?”
     Us (still excited): “No, we’re actually paying off our mortgage!”
     Banker (with as little emotion as possible): “Congratulations.
           That’s the dream.”
     Seven minutes later, still typing and clicking.
     Banker: “Alright, the wire transfer will happen at some point today. Is there anything else I can do for you?”
     Us (deflated): “Nope. Thanks.”

     While the bar is low, I hope your mortgage payoff experience is way more exciting than ours was. In any case, I tell you these stories from my journey, not to brag about how awesome I am with money, but to encourage you that if any normal, broke, average George like me can take control of their money and build wealth, you can too.

     The financial transformation I experienced by following this proven plan was insane. Over ten years, I went from a negative net worth to a $1 million net worth. I went from broke to millionaire. In a decade. I also saw huge personal transformation. And while it was hard, it was also incredibly simple.

     There’s a great quote that beautifully sums up my financial journey: “Most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year and underestimate what they can accomplish in a decade.” That was me for sure. For too long, I thought someone like me couldn’t get ahead with money. Thank God for the ability to change our minds, our beliefs, and our actions.

​​​​​​​     It was possible for me. And the good news is, it’s possible for you too. It won’t be a cakewalk. Or a walk in the park. Or a piece of cake. Come to think of it, there’s not much walking or cake involved here at all. But by the time you’re done with this book, you’ll be confident in your ability to buck the system, ditch debt, and build wealth. And the financial peace you’ll feel as a result is the icing on the cake.

Welcome To The Gap
     Quick spoiler alert before we go any further—because I’d hate to mislead you. This isn’t really a book about money. It’s a book about turning money from a stressor to a blesser, so that you can focus on building a life and legacy you’re proud of. It’s about gaining the things money can’t buy, but that money problems can hold you back from: peace, patience, self-control, freedom, margin, options, and joy.

     But here’s what you’ve got to understand: The gap between financial stress and financial peace is littered with traps, myths, distractions, and slick marketing designed to keep you brainwashed and broke.

     Maybe you’ve felt buried by some of those myths and a lack of financial literacy, with no understanding of how to dig out from the pile. Maybe you’ve been your own biggest obstacle, sabotaging your progress with excuses, justifications, and impulse spending for as long as you can remember. Maybe your life has been filled with legitimate challenges and hardships that have left you cleaning up a mess you didn’t choose to make. Maybe, like me, it was a poo-pourri of all the above. What really matters isn’t what got you here, but what you can do, starting today, to get to the good side of the gap, where money stress is just a memory.

     Whether you believe it or not, you are your best shot at bridging the gap. And over the next 16 chapters, we’ll tackle your best excuses and the worst myths head-on, building that bridge with truth, knowledge, and hope.

     On the other side of that gap is the life you never thought would be possible. Where you own every blade of dead grass in the yard. Where the car drives differently because it doesn’t have a payment weighing it down. Where your kid’s education and your retirement are locked and loaded. Where you get to take vacations you always dreamed of and help others the way you always wished you could. And best of all, where you wake up every morning knowing you’re free and clear, owing nobody anything.

     That’s a future worth fighting for. It’s go time.

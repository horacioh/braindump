## Summary

## Highlights

- Specifically, the company has messed with the way that users retweet other tweets. As of Tuesday, a new feature that appears to be rolled out to all users changes what happens when you hit the little circular-arrows button that appears at the bottom of every tweet. Instead of asking in a small pop-up menu if you want to retweet the post, or quote-tweet it, a larger window pops up prompting you to add your own commentary before adding the tweet to your timeline: [tweet image](https://compote.slate.com/images/94f2c998-84c7-4fd9-a6cc-36a48123774f.jpeg?width=1440&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0)
- They are also adding warnings to pieces of misinformation. _How do they measure that??_
- > The Twitter executives said the “extra friction” on retweets will prompt users to add their own thoughts before they hit the button. If users decide they don’t have anything to add, they will be able to retweet after the prompt.

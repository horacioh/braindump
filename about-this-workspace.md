# About this workspace

- treating some todos as pages (`- [ ] [[todo page]]`) turns out to work well, I can keep track on where I added and where I did it
- I have a general todo page with all the todos without a date
- on my journal I add the todos I want to do for the day
  - if I don't do it, I remove the `[ ]` from it a leave it there, that way I keep the reference of when I commited to do something but didn't (dunno if this kind of data is useful but ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) and then i move the todo either to another day or to the `todo` page
  - not all my todos are pages, some of them are normal todos
  - I try to add tags to every todo, that way it gives me a little more context
    - this is something I would love to see on the page references: `see the context in which a page was mentioned`
- I don't have any hierarchy in the file structure other than my `journal`, so I try that all my filenames starts with `<project>-*`. that way they will stack together in the file explorer
- I have an `inbox` page where I add everything I see from the internet to see/review/do/create.

# Getting Started with JavaScript, v2 with Kyle Simpson

- values
  - no difference between integers and floats
  - `null` and `undefined` are "empty" values
  - basic building blocks
  - important to understand how to represent tassks that we want to accomplish
- operations
  - [MDN docs: Espressions and Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators)
  - `+` operator is overloaded (more than one operation depending on where its used)
  - binary operators (two operands involved)
  - unary operators (single operand)
  - comparisons (== => loose equality)
  - logical operators (`||`, `&&`...)
- types
  - `typeof`: unary operator
  - `typeof null` = `object` IS A BUG
  - `Array` is a subtype of `Object`
- variable
  - pointer, address, representation of some place in memory
  - help use give useful names to values
  - `=` assignment operator

- types and coercion
  - primitive types
    - "in JS, everything is an object" => NOT TRUE
    - undefined
    - string
    - number
    - boolean
    - object
    - symbol
    - null
    - function (subtype)
    - array (subtype)
  - NaN
    - the result of when JS can't convert values to make operations (divide a string by 2)
  - new
    - to create an instance of an object
    - cannot use it with `String` `Boolean` `Number` (it will change the type of the value to `object`)
    - 
  - coercion
    - super important
    - anytime theres a mathematical operation with a string operand, it will convert all to string
    - exercise: make sure we convert input values to nomber to make operations
  - booleans
    - values can be evaluate it to `true or false
    - automatically happens in all if statements (inside the `()`)
    - `!!`. `<`, `>` to explicitly convert values to booleans
    - `<`, `>` convert operands to numbers implicitly
  - coercion best practices
    - make the types on any operation clear
    - useful: when the reader is focused on what's important
    - dangerous: when the reader can't tell what will happen
    - Better: when the reader understands the code
  - equality
    - `==` vs `===`
    - `==` allows coercion
    - `===` disallows coercion
    - show the difference with checking for `null` and `undefined`
  - types summary
    - is coercion helpful in this case?

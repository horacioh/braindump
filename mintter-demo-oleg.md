## Things to improve

- point to the editor below a transclusion should create a new block below
- press the down key should also create a new block
- tranclude a document to where the selection is at that moment
- ~~Open~~ Show in Sidepanel
- click the "show in sidepanel"
  - open the sidepanel
  - scroll to the block position
- error when press enter and there was a little content on the right of the selection
  - sometimes the caret moved to the new block and sometimes it stayed in the previous block
- show backlinks in the document's list items
  - transclusions and citations
- many citations = represents a larger crosscut of the opinion
  - pagerank should be higher?
- not difference between citation and transclusion
- trust is higher if the amount of interactions is big
- paper
  - citation index: how many was cited
- academia rankins
  - avg citation ranking
  - impact factor of a journal: better citation indices
    - the more cites the higher index
- quote does not really make sense
- you cite others to support your statements
- maybe a list of citations on each document?
- when someone cites your document it could be good to notify the user
- rich hyperlinks

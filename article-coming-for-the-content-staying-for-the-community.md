## Summary

## Highlights

- I spent about three years as part of that team and the notion of “staying for the community” lodged itself deep in my cranial matter
- The “absolutely yes” category was dominated by creators who had branched beyond their initial piece of content and created some persistent space for the community to aggregate. Most typically in Slack, Facebook, WhatsApp or Discord. What they’ve done is use their content to assemble an audience and then create a space for that audience to create content with each other — aka community
- But the most interesting ones broaden to envelop the general common interest areas of the group
- [example: Lenny Rachitsky writes a newsletter](https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/)

> I’m of the belief that “Come for the Content, Stay for the Community” will be one of the dominating themes for media this decade

- So it’s not a question of “how many newsletters can one person pay for?” it’s “how many communities does someone want to be a part of?”

# How to Take Smart Notes

## Introduction

- Ignoring the part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the _organisation_ of all writing makes a difference.
- You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas.
- You can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward
- if we take notes _unsystematically_, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in teh midst of a deadline panic and wonder there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them.
- Writing is the _medium_ of all reasearch, learning or studying
- Good, productive writing is based on good _note-taking_.
- Writing something again from your notes is far easier than assembling it in your mind and trying to retrieve it from there.

### Everything you need to know

- A good structure is something you can trust. with a robust system, you can rely on it and focus on the important thing: **The content, the arguments and the ideas**. A good structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time.
- Having read more does not automatically mean more ideas. Especially in the beginning, it means having fewer ideas to work with, because you know that others have already thought of most of them.

- That is why good, productive writing is based on good note-taking. Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there.

- To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.

- A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas.

- It is certainly not the lack of interesting topics, but rather the employment of problematic work routines that seems to take charge of us instead of allowing us to steer the process in the right direction. A good, structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time.

- Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts.

- What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent.

- While some career-oriented academics try to squeeze as many publications out of one idea as possible, Luhmann seemed to do the opposite. He constantly generated more ideas than he was able to write down. His texts read as if he is trying to squeeze as much insight and as many ideas as possible into one publication.

- Strictly speaking, Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read.

Location 404-405 | Added on Sunday, April 25, 2021 10:20:25 AM

- Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box.

- In a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box.

- He usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the slip-box. And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript:

Location 412-415 | Added on Sunday, April 25, 2021 10:24:18 AM

- More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes. He then would add references to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts. Some were directly related and read more like comments, others contained not-so-obvious connections. Rarely would a note stay in isolation.

Your Note on Location 415 | Added on Sunday, April 25, 2021 10:25:09 AM

Location 422-424 | Added on Sunday, April 25, 2021 10:40:24 AM

- If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note. If the existing note had the number 22, the new note would become note number 23. If 23 already existed, he named the new note 22a.

- Adding a note directly behind another note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system. This very much resembles, of course, the way we use hyperlinks on the internet. But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper.

- The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points.

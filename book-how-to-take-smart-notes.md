# How to Take Smart Notes

## Introduction

- Ignoring the part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the *organisation* of all writing makes a difference.
- You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas.
- You can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward
- if we take notes *unsystematically*, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in teh midst of a deadline panic and wonder there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them.
- Writing is the *medium* of all reasearch, learning or studying
- Good, productive writing is based on good *note-taking*.
- Writing something again from your notes is far easier than assembling it in your mind and trying to retrieve it from there.

### Everything you need to know

- A good structure is something you can trust. with a robust system, you can rely on it and focus on the important thing: **The content, the arguments and the ideas**. A good structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time.
- Having read more does not automatically mean more ideas. Especially in the beginning, it means having fewer ideas to work with, because you know that others have already thought of most of them.

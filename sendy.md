# sendy

- [website](https://sendy.co/)
- is a senf-hosted platform for sending emails
- it's written in PHP
- it uses Amazon SES to send emails, which is pretty cheap
- it seems to have all the features a newsletter may want, but I saw that it could be very simple and you cannot add that many automations.
- the latest reviews I saw were from 2019, so maybe they change a little since I see in the website that you can add tags to subscribers, and that way segment them.
- here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q2zrG1F3os) explaining how it works (basiccally)
- very focused on WordPress integrations (PHP based software)
- you need to install it in a VPS or a server of choice.

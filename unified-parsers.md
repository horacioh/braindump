    - something that takes your code, and converts it into a syntax tree
    - it has nodes that describe what’s happening in your program
    - each node has a type and some other arbitrary data
    - almost everything uses ASTs under the hood
    - **review the “Visitor pattern”**
    - syntax trees are complex, is very important to know your node types well in order to work with them.

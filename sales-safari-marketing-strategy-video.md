- [This ONE Marketing STRATEGY Will Replace EVERYTHING Else! | Jay Abraham on Preeminence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gw14EJkzYs)

- "The strategy of preeminence is a philosophical strategy that I believe once you learn it, you will use to replace everything else you have adhered to as far as the driving strategic force behind everything you do, everything your team does, every relationship you have, and the way you relate to everybody in your business and in your life."
- who you are selling to?
- change the focus, you are not the saler and they are the client. you are his/her advisor, expert, consejero, fiduciario.
- you want them to see you as their advisor and expert, and that comes with trust. You must offer only based on what is best for them, not you or anybody. that's how you earn trust.
- If you want to be the most interesting person in the world, you must become the must **INTERESTED**, all you have to do is listen to others and give value to others.
- Preeminence strategy: **examine, understand, emphatixe, respect, appreciate, carfeully evaluate** how everyone sees life. you dont have to agree wth it, but you need to empathise with it in other to serve them

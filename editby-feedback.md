- The UI can be more like an App and not like a web
- when using the ++ when I have content already in the paragraph, it creates a new paragraph when it finishes. the `++` feature is magic btw, it's awesome!
- would be nice to store all the URLs, keywords and anything I use to generate any content as post references. I believe is fair to all the creators I based my work on.
- a "regenerate" button would be awesome when using the AI autocomplete

- Analysis and Design: about making sure we understand, and are solving, problems
- don't let users define problems, we should analyse and reinterpret what _really_ the problem is, and come up with a result that satisfy user's needs
- avoiding problems != solbing problems
- Solving problems requires understanging, recognizing and stating them
- Problem solving is a _skill_ and take **practice**
- to start solving problems:
  - we need to state what the problem is, out loud, or written... anything but needs to be clear
  - we need to understand the problem
    - what you know? (facts, context, constraints...)
    - what you don't know?
    - are there any related problems?
      - seeing other similar problems solved, could give you insights on how to start solving yours
  - Be discerning
    - not all solutions are awesome!, self-awareness is important
    - identify problems in your solutions
    - any solution has tradeoffs, and is important to know those
    - no questions? very rare...
  - More input, better output
    - if you don't know it, you can't apply it to your solutions/problems
    - learn about your space
    - being critical about other solutions
  - Tradeoffs
    - tradeoffs are created after you compare at least two solutions and see what is good and bad about them
  - Focus
    - you can't do everything, and having focus time to really solve your problem, you need to be _gone_ (and let your love ones know you are in this focus phase)
- Wakind mind
  - good at critical thinking
  - good at analysing what is in front
  - good at finding the local maxima
  - use your waking mind to feed work to your background mind
  - good at being critical with what your background mind comes up with
- Background mind
  - good at making connections
  - synthesis
  - strategy
  - :code abstractions are strategies
  - here's where you solve most of non-trivial problems
  - the problem is that youc an only feed it...
- while we are sleeping, we find hidden relations among memories.
- problems are more complex than what we can load to our backfground mind. what should we do?
  - white all the proposed solutions down
  - go over them, in different orders
  - hammock time is important!! get away from the computer to avoid any other inputs
- and then, wait for it...
  - at least wait one night before you take an important decision, sometimes more nights...months...
- Wake up morning: you got a solution overnight for one of your ideas, now what?
  - try it: eventually coding is required
  - try it again: feedback loop is important
- You will be wrong
  - that's ok
  - you will think on better ideas
  - **Facts change**, do the whole process again and see if your solutions still applies, if not, do the process again
  - don't be afraid of being wrong, that's normal!

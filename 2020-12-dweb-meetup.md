## Paul frazee: Choosing Not to ship

> Beaker 1.0 was lauched!! ðŸŽ‰

- they did not ship social features
  - twitter clone
  - comment section on _any_ page
  - RSS reader
  - Notifications
- trying to do both browser and social network and it was not either of them
- making the whole experience more cohesive takes freedom to the user to choose and do whatever they want
- focus on what Beaker really is: **P2P websites**
- **choose a title and then change to the editor** #mintter
- https://twitter.com/BeakerBrowser/status/1334213292978548739

> I chat with colleagues Mark Dalgleish (https://twitter.com/markdalgleish) and Matt Jones (https://twitter.com/mattcompiles) about their latest OSS library Vanilla Extract.

- the recommended way to import styles is by using `* as X`, wonder how they can do tree-shaking or if they care about it?
- you can use your static styles as the source of truth for your TS types in your JS code (ðŸ¤¯)

- not production-safe yet as of October 2021
- interesting the `createPattern` API

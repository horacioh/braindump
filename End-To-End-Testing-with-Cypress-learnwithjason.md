## getting started with Cypress

```bash
cd to/your/repo
npm i -D cypress
```

It will install:

- the latest version of Cypress
- the Cypress app in your users folder (if not present, just the first time)

you can now run:

```bash
cypress run # ci environments
cypress open # opens the Cypress app for interactive mode
```

## takeaways

- is really easy to setup
- very good tooling to review and see the tests live when they are running
- you have also selector helpers that you can use and paste them in your tests

## Big O

- [[Big O]] it tries to define what is the complexity of an computation or a mathematical problem.
    - if describes the complexity based on the most complex term in the formula (3x² + x + 1)
- complexity is measure in multiple ways, but usually is measure in time
- readability and maintainability is the most important in computer science
- On² == Cuadratic time == Linear time
- logarithmic algos it does take time, but the more items you add, the time does not change much
- spatial complexity depends in multiple things that it sometines does not matter much if the devices when is running the algo is powerfull.

## Trade Offs

- going through solutions thinking about its trade offs is more impresive when talking with other more senior developers or even in a job interview
- Readability and Maintainability is more important than anything else.

## Bubble sort

- iterate over all teh items and "swap" items that are next to each other until it finishes the loop
- it keeps swapping elements until no swap happends on a whole loop

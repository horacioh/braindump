# CUBE CSS

tags: [[css]]

- methodology
- embraces the cascade
- CUBE = Composition, Utility, Block, Exceptions
- the naming of the classes is not a requirement, you do whatever communicates best with your team

## Acronym explanation

### Composition

- is the skeleton layout
- it does not matter the contents, it matters how you position the blocks on the page.
- all about [every layout](https://every-layout.dev)

### Utility

- does one thing and JUST one thing well
- similar to what TailwindCSS does

### blocks

- very specific elements, not _every_ element

### Exceptions

- subtle changes between similar blocks
- usually applied it as data attributes
- specificity wins (use importants if necesary)

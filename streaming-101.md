## JUST CLICK THAT RED BUTTON (LIVE)!!

## Order you can buy Gear

- [camera](#camera)
- mic
- lights
- overlays

## Microphones

- you can start with normal Headphones with mic. I started with the ones that comes with the iPhone
- USB mics are easy to use and easy to manage
- the next level would be to get an audio interface and a XLR mic. HUGE quality jump but harder to manage
-

## Cameras

- start with your laptop webcam.
- the higher quality the better!
- **remember that you need to start with what you have!!**
- **a 50$ camera + a 50$ light will look 100x better than a 1k$ camera with NO light**

## Lights

- any light can work as a key light!, I'm using a very cheap LED light right now
- you can go the Elgato route, but that's expensive
- **a 50$ camera + a 50$ light will look 100x better than a 1k$ camera with NO light**

# Streaming 101

## Tips & Tricks

- **JUST CLICK THAT RED BUTTON (LIVE)!!**
- **stick to a calendar** (example: Monday, wednesday & friday)
- **You don't grow while you are**
- Not recommended to stream daily: if you stream 3 days/week, you can create YT videos on the other days to get discovered!
- Networking should not be your top priority
- wait to talk to companies until you "earn it"
- shortcuts will hurt you
- Don't neglect just chatting: **This is how you start building relationships with your viewers**
- The benefit of a Giveaway when oyu are new are very little compared to invest that time on improving your stream quality (get better gear, get better overlays...)
- start a youtube channel. Do not reupload your VOD to it, create a BRAND NEW content related to your twitch streams
- DO NOT do follow-for-follow

## Gear

- order you should get gear: [Camera](#cameras), [Mic](#microphones), [Lights](#lights) & Overlays
- a 50$ camera + a 50$ light will look 100x better than a 1k\$ camera with NO light
- try to put your camera to the side of your display. having the camera on top of it makes it feel more awkward

### Microphones

- you can start with normal Headphones with mic. I started with the ones that comes with the iPhone
- USB mics are easy to use and easy to manage
- the next level would be to get an audio interface and a XLR mic. HUGE quality jump but harder to manage
-

### Cameras

- start with your laptop webcam.
- the higher quality the better!
- **remember that you need to start with what you have!!**
- **a 50$ camera + a 50$ light will look 100x better than a 1k$ camera with NO light**

### Lights

- any light can work as a key light!, I'm using a very cheap LED light right now
- you can go the Elgato route, but that's expensive
- **a 50$ camera + a 50$ light will look 100x better than a 1k$ camera with NO light**

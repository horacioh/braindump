# Kent & Taylor Remote Workshop Talk

- Not scalable forever
  - every person detracts from everyone else
  - Kent has a limit to 40
  - some questions will not get answered
- making the workshop more engaging by breaking the group into smaller groups
- wait after sessions
- breakout rooms
  - "say your name" and intros
  - just on exercise time
  - encourage working together
- isolated exercise type
  - source with all the exercises on separate files (Epic React way)
- create the exercise code:
  - create the final version
  - copy the file
  - remove the bits you want them to do
  - add help comments!
- help them to know what questions to ask!
- emojis on comments are visual triggers
- make exercises the way to set the right mindset to what's coming
- the "code along" workshop type
  - hard to maintain
  - hard to follow and learn
  - everything separate in branches
- automate as much as you can!
- feedback form for workshops
- **How successful will be people following the material?**
- super important to prepare the content VERY WELL

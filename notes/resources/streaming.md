# Tips & Tricks

- **stick to a calendar** (example: Monday, wednesday & friday)
- **You don't grow while you are**
- Not recommended to stream daily: if you stream 3 days/week, you can create YT videos on the other days to get discovered!
- Networking should not be your top priority
- wait to talk to companies until you "earn it"
- shortcuts will hurt you
- Don't neglect just chatting: **This is how you start building relationships with your viewers**
- The benefit of a Giveaway when oyu are new are very little compared to invest that time on improving your stream quality (get better gear, get better overlays...)
- start a youtube channel. Do not reupload your VOD to it, create a BRAND NEW content related to your twitch streams
- DO NOT do follow-for-follow

## Software

- add transitions when you change your scenes
- use Streamlabs OBS or OBS to stream
- you can use either Streamlabs or StreamElements as your chatbot/overlays software
- tweetAlerts.tv if you want to show a tweet source on stream
- setup your Desktop audio + mic as a source on Streamlabs OBS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gzFKtJf3po

## Gear

- order you should get gear: Camera, Mic, Lights & Overlays
- a 50$ camera + a 50$ light will look 100x better than a 1k\$ camera with NO light
- try to put your camera to the side of your display. having the camera on top of it makes it feel more awkward

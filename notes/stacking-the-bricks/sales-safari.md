# Sales Safari

- Sales safari Goals:
  - identify good sources of data
  - identify the first level of pain (obvious)
  - identify the second level of pain (why is this even being talked about? what’s the core here? why do they care?)
  - turn that, using a handy dandy process, into what people want (their dream)…
  - and, via the same process, brainstorm many product concepts based on this
  - and also, same research again, come up with marketing content that the audience will go crazy for (read, use, share)
  - and how to use that to bootstrap your very first product
- Understand your audience vocabulary
- identify pain points
  - then, of course, think of solutions

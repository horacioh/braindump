# Badass: making users awesome

- what is the difference between bestsellers and non-bestsellers?
- tolerance for problems is a function of desirability
    - Quality can drive desirability
    - Desirability can drive (perceive) tolerance
- reframing problems as **NOT problems** is a function of debris ability
- the more we desire/like something, the more not just we tolerate problems, but reinterpret as not-problems
- Quality does not guarantee desirability
- brand engagement is not a long-term sustained strategy for success. 
- bestsellers are recommended
- people recommend not about the product or the service, they recommend because they feel better about themselves. they recommend how awesome they are using your product/service
- "I'm awesome because of this" is the right feeling behind "This thing is awesome"
- want people to say "you **must** get this"
- the key attributes of sustained success is not in the product, the key attributes lives in the users
    - look for common attributes across successful users of the product
- our products need to help our users to be awesome, not the other way around
- the first step to create successful users is to _observe_ successful users
- your product and your competitors are a subset of something greater. it's crucial to identify that (example: video editing software, mics and cameras are a subset of creating awesome videos)
- tools matter. but being a master of a tool is rarely our user's desire goal
- if we really want badass users, we need to focus on what they really want throughout the whole journey, not only before they buy, they want badass results
- better than word of mouth, is mouth of obvious. that's when others talk about your badass users
- "fabulous customer service " sounds user-centric but it's not. the star should always be the user. and anything you do must help them become badass

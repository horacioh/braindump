## [Pick a Lesson Title](https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-pick-a-lesson-title)

- "How do I" approach
- asking this before the title, let the user know exactly what they are getting out of it

## [Teach Step-by-Step](https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-teach-step-by-step)

- separate your lesson into steps.
- you don't have to be explicit by saying the steps, but it also can help you as a guidance while recording

## [Show first, then maybe explain](https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-show-first-then-maybe-explain)

- Show exactly WHAT to do, then explain if necessary.
- Often times the previous explanation ends being unnecessary. Explain after you show.

## [Remove Distractions](https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-remove-distractions)

- take out all distractions from your screen
- I do have a separate VSCode settings when teaching
- you can also use [ezprompt.net](http://ezprompt.net/) to clean your prompt
- use split screen and make your editor take out most of the space and the browser the remaining.
- setup a high-contrast theme in your code editor.
- Bump up the font size on both the browser (demo) and your editor

## [Avoid Intros and Outros](https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-avoid-intros-and-outros)

- "Just start doing it".
- Use the Lesson description for Intro.
- avoid exits, and mention "the next lesson"

## [Stay on Topic](https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-stay-on-topic)

- Avoid explanations of things that are not related to the actual topic.

  - screen resolution is 1280x720 hidp
  - mic has good levels

## [Record One thought at a time](https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-record-one-thought-at-a-time)

- Just press record
- anything can happen, but you are recording so you can record again.
- relax and go thought by thought.
- use as many takes as you want!
- take your time. stop, think, record. Rinse & repeat
- remember you can EDIT. don't worry about mistakes, you can cut them out later.

> **Horacio's Tip:** when I record a take that I like, I "clap" at the end of it. That helps me reduce time editing, because I can go to the audio high picks and cut that part without the need of listening the whole record again

## [Edit with Ripple Delete](https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-edit-with-ripple-delete)

- delete all the bad parts and keep the good parts.
- `ctrl + T` to Ripple delete in Screenflow
- in iMovie is `cmd + B` to cut a take and then select and delete the bad parts

- Prettier helps a lot with this lately

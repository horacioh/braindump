## Creation collection with Tomasz (zoom call)

- start creating notes
- helps to keep you from going to wide of to deep
- 40+ lessons into collections could indicate you are doing 2 collections
- Every lesson should be possible to watch independently
- plan lessons in a way that the order make sense (kinda obvious)
- are collections ever finished?
  - He does not think they have an end, but that is contradictory to the 40+ lessons statement
- collections are lessons that the idea is connected with one another
  - not sure if I understand this one...
- types of collections
  - `Ever-Growing list` (Svelte version)
    - started with 4 and now is 20+
    - Ideas on my head published into egghead
  - `Not-so-Ever-Growing list` (Cypress collection)
    - it involved some planning
    - clear view of what you want to cover
- Tomasz is doing collections using both types
- re-watch your videos can help you get ideas for more lessons even in between others
- share content more than once is important to reach more people
- engage with conversations about the content you created
- `Tweet-Every-lesson` strategy
  - Twitter threads explaining a little more about them
- progressive summarization! (see references)
- try to start with the end of a collection and go backwards

- **Tips for first-timers**

  - your first collection does not need to be your best topic/more advanced one. It could be something simple
  - define if you want to go Wide or Deep, try not to do both
  - Your collection does not have to be finished before you publish. WIP is better than nothing
    - you can get people feedback and adjust/add the next lessons

- if you go wide but want to go deeper into a topic, treat it as a separate collection
  - you can link your deeper collection into your wider collection lesson!
- create content the way you like to consume it and would be useful to you
- optimizing for bordem
  - is better to make some people borded for a couple of seconds, than having people confused and not know about a topic/idea.
- 45secs in an Egghead video is an Eternity! ðŸ˜‚

## Egghead collections

(url: https://howtoegghead.com/instructor/collections/)

- "A collection is a playlist of videos that can share a common theme and be shared and promoted to your audience."
- planning and collaboration is not required for collections (as opposed to Courses)
- "A collection of lessons is a great place to experiment and create content without a lot of friction to the process. This can give you the freedom to explore ideas and subjects that you find interesting and useful."

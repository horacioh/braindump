# AppSync as an API Gateway

When building a GraphQL APIs it is common to have existing microservices served via traditional REST APIs that need to be integrated into the schema and accessed via GraphQL queries and mutations. In this talk, you'll learn how to add custom HTTP and Lambda function resolvers to map existing REST endpoints and other API calls directly from Amplify.

### Deploy a Lambda function with API Gateway {#lambda-function-api-gateway}

1. Create a Lambda function and API (REST HTTP endpoint)

```bash

amplify add function
amplify add api

// Choose REST with Express backend
```

2. Write code / make changes to your lambda functions
3. Deploy (or mock)

```bash
 amplify push
```

### AWS Lambda Overview

![Lambda Overview](./lambda-overview.png)

- Run code without provisioning or managing any servers
- pay only for the compute time you consume
- Dynamically scales function execution in response to increased traffic
- Event-based
  - API Gateway
  - Other Lambda (AWS SDK)
  - DynamoDB / S3 / Aurora / Cognito / SQS / Lex / etc

### Demo Serverless function

1. create a new react app

```bash
npx create-react-app demo-sls-app
cd demo-sls-app
amplify init
```

1. Init the amplify client SDK

```bash
amplify init
```

1. Start adding services

- you can also run `amplify status` to check all the services installed and available

- fill the questions with almost all the default answers (or the ones that suits best your environment/needs)

1. Setup an AWS profile (if you don't already have one)

- again, fill the questions with almost all the default answers (or the ones that suits best your environment/needs)

1. add your first function

```bash
amplify add funtion
```

- follow the questions
- template types:

  - Hello world function: simple function
  - CRUD for DynamoDB table: all the normal CRUD operations
  - Serverless express function: it allow us to run an full Express server in a serverless function. it will generate a normal server code node app function in your project

- for this example we will use **serverless express**

1. Setup the React app

- install `aws-amplify` in the React app (check the docs)
- `Amplify.configure(config)` inside the root component
- call the new endpoint using the `API` category from `aws-amplify`

```js
try {
  const data = await API.get("ENDPOINT_NAME", "/ENDPOINT_PATH");
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```

1. Install axios on our functions

- that way we can do HTTP request to other REST APIs from our functions
- you need to install it inside the specific function's folder (where you see the `package.json` file). then you can do `yarn add axios`
- then you can do a normal API call to your other REST API and return its data to your serverless function

- you can even add authentication to an specific endpoint! ðŸ¤¯
- you can modify any services using `amplify update <SERVICE>`

### Multiple environments

- using `amplify env`
- create a new one: `amplify env add`

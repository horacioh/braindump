# How to Interview

[[2020-12-20]] [[advent-of-writing]] #articles

**DISCLAIMER**: If you landed here looking for better ways to do interviews this is not the place. I'm actually asking that question myself!

Recently I've been watching a couple of episodes of the [YouTube series Hot Ones](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ). The show is very funny and insightfull. I love it, mainly because the show host is a master at interviews!, you just have to watch a couple to notice it and see the reactions of some of the guests after hearing the questions he had for them. But the interview is the result of a really good research about the subject.

I'm really interested on the process of how to create interviews like this; What are the things they (I assume he i snot the only one doing this but maybe that's the case) look for, how and then what are the things they consider to choose the final questions and the whole interview itself.

Would love to understand and learn from it. Maybe the same techniques can be used to other activities!.

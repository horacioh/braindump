- writing about [[Freelancing]] and [[Job openings]]
- Not talking about "Tabu topics" like money or sex, leads to miss-information and low knowledge spread. the more you talk about something "tabu", the better insights and ideas for others and more people sharing the same "tabu" topic leads to more collective knowledge #tabu #knowledge #thoughts #learning
- It's been reported that the amount of young people with anxiety and stress is high with the pandemic, I believe this is because many reasons, but mainly because we haven't teach youngers to learn to be with themselves, they depend too much on what others do or say (social media). I believe that this pandemic helped flourish all the psycological problems people had been creating but didn't notice because of the massive noice and lifestyles we all have. #anxiety #future #lifestyle #young #pandemic #stress
